Initial prompt - very basic instructions:
** Create a web map application to load one of the layers from the WMS Service at https://gibs.earthdata.nasa.gov/wmts/epsg4326/best/wmts.cgi?request=GetCapabilities. When the layer has different times available, the application should offer a way to navigate the different dates. 

Adding search capabilities (to find a layer amongst a fairly large number of layers)
** Modify the application to allow the user to search for the layer they want to display by typing some part of the name

To find the styles applicable to the selected layer and allow users to select from these options
** If there are any styles defined for the selected layer, show them in a dropdown to allow the user to select one.

To list the dates for the selected layer
** Show the available dates for the selected layer in a dropdown

Toggle layer on/off
** Add a toggle button to show/hide the layer

Let user set the transparency
** Add a slider to control the transparency of the layer

Move controls to a side panel
** Place all controls in a collapsible panel on the left side of the map
